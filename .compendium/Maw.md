**Maws** are immense, ancient skeletal remains of unknown origin found throughout the [galaxy](/compendium/Milky_Way). Maws enable instantaneous interstellar travel by way of [void portals](/compendium/Void_portal) located within their jaws.

[Amoeboids](/compendium/Amoeboid) are the only known species native to the maws, and were first discovered on the [Etilion maw](/compendium/Etilion_maw) by early [elven](/compendium/Elf) explorers.

There are currently 124 known maws in the galaxy.
