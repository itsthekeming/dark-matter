**Miara Walvyr** was a female [elf](/compendium/Elf) [gadgeteer](/compendium/Gadgeteer) and warden of the [Freemantle Penal Colony](/compendium/Freemantle_Penal_Colony).

During an escape attempt from the penal colony, Walvyr battled the [crew of the Clank](/compendium/Crew_of_the_Clank). After sustaining heavy injuries, she retreated to a nearby facility. [Ã†gis](/compendium/SPEER_Unit_71120-xis) destroyed said facility with the [EINS Spitfire](/compendium/EINS_Spitfire)'s auto-cannons shortly thereafter, presumably killing Walvyr.
