**Miara Walvyr** was a female [Elf](/compendium/Elf) [Gadgeteer](/compendium/Gadgeteer) and Warden of the [Freemantle Penal Colony](/compendium/Freemantle_Penal_Colony).

During an escape attempt from the penal colony, Walvyr battled [Hann Seastrand](/compendium/Hann_Seastrand), [Ægis](/compendium/SPEER_Unit_71120-xis), [Lilbi Silverdrop]('/compendium/Lilbi_Silverdrop'), [Ratchet]('/compendium/Albert_Kang_III), and [Alphie](/compendium/Imperial_Intelligence_Unit_37). After sustaining heavy injuries, she retreated to a nearby facility. [Ægis](/compendium/SPEER_Unit_71120-xis) destroyed said facility with the [EINS Spitfire](/compendium/EINS_Spitfire)'s auto-cannons shortly thereafter, presumably killing Walvyr.
