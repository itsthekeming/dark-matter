**The Albatross** (formerly: **EINS Spitfire**) is a personal class [ship](/compendium/Ship) with advanced stealth capabilities. Formerly known as the **EINS Spitfire**, it was built by [Elven Imperial Intelligence](/compendium/Elven_Imperial_Intelligence). The ship was commandeered by the [crew of The Clank](/compendium/Crew_of_the_Clank) upon their escape from [Freemantle Penal Colony](/compendium/Freemantle_Penal_Colony) on [Exodus VII](/compendium/Exodus_VII). The group then overrode the ship's [transponder](/compendium/Transponder) signal with the current name to avoid detection.

## The EINS Spitfire

Records aboard the ship suggest that it was an experimental vessel constructed to take advantage of the [anti-magic research taking place on Exodus VII](/compendium/Anti-magic_research_on_Exodus_VII).

It is unknown exactly when the ship was built or if it underwent any missions prior to its takeover by the the crew of The Clank.

When it was stolen by the crew of The Clank, the ship was stocked with enough rations and equipment for a full month of interstellar travel.

## Commandeered

After starting a riot in the [Freemantle Penal Colony](/compendium/Freemantle_Penal_Colony), the crew of The Clank advanced to a nearby spaceport. They ascended a landing platform and found [Warden Miara Walvyr](/compendium/Miara_Walvyr) standing at the entrance the Spitfire. After a battle, the crew of The Clank commandeered the ship and utilized its weapons to blast out of the facility, destroying several buildings, landing platforms, and Elven fighter-craft in the process.

The crew then used the ship's [Dark Matter engine](/compendium/Dark_Matter_engine) to make a daring from the [Exodus system](/compendium/Exodus).
