**Bulettes**, also called **land sharks**, are large [monstrosities](/compendium/Monstrosity) found on many planets in the galaxy. A bulette can be identified by its distinct armored hide and beak-like mouth. Bulettes also have large claws suited for digging, and are known to dig and live in extensive underground tunnel systems.
