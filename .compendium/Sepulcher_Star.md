The **Sepulcher Star**, also known as the **Sepulcher system**, is a massive [star](/compendium/Star) located in the [Galactic Core](/compendium/Galactic_Core). It is tidally locked in orbit around an equally large [supermassive black hole](/compendium/Black_Hole). The Sepulcher system has no planets, and the only orbiting body of any kind is the [Solar Citadel](/compendium/Solar_Citadel).

The Sepulcher star is larger than any other observed star in the known universe. It appears to ignore all accepted laws of physics, which dictate that it should have burnt out hundreds of millions of years ago.

Many religions throughout the galaxy worship the star, primarily the [Avia-Ra](/compendium/Avia-Ra), who see it as an embodiment of their deity, [Old Un](/compendium/Old_Un).

The star is expected to be consumed completely by the nearby supermassive black hole in approximately 750,000 standard galactic years.
